### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, remember that "good" design is subjective; however, your site should look polished. Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
* Use mobile-first design.
* Choose a color palette that distinguishes your site from the default Bootstrap theme and unstyled HTML sites. Refer to resources like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.
* Ensure that the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
* Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it might impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.
